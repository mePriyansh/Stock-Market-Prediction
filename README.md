I recently delved into the fascinating domain of stock market analysis and forecasting, leveraging the power of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model within a dedicated project. For this venture, I harnessed an arsenal of cutting-edge tools and technologies, including:

Python, serving as the backbone for crucial tasks such as data preprocessing, manipulation, visualization, and the implementation of the model itself.
Jupyter Notebook, providing an immersive and interactive coding environment that streamlined the development process.
The Keras library, which played a pivotal role in the seamless construction and training of the LSTM model, ensuring robust and accurate predictions.
